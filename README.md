# Analyzing Factors Affecting Car Prices in Canada
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis to identify and understand the key factors that affect used car prices in Canada. By exploring historical second hand car price data and relevant variables, we can gain insights into the market dynamics and make informed predictions about future trends.

### Execution Plan for Development:
**1. Data Collection:**
Gather a comprehensive dataset containing car sales information from various sources.

**2. Data Preprocessing:**
Clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and converting categorical variables into 
numerical representations.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Visualize and analyze relationships between car features and prices to gain insights.

**4. Feature Engineering:**
Create new variables or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive model's performance.

**5. Model Building:**
Use regression techniques like linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting to 
build the predictive model.

**6. Model Evaluation:**
Assess the model's performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R-squared.

**7. Model Selection:**
Compare different models to select the one with the best accuracy in predicting car prices.

**8. Interpretation and Insights:**
Interpret the model's coefficients to identify the most influential factors affecting car prices using python 
libraries for visualization.

**9. Summarization:**
Summarize the findings and insights, providing valuable information for the automotive industry stakeholders.

By following these steps, systematic planning and execution of the project could be implemented, ensuring a 
thorough analysis of the correlations and dependencies within the car pricing dataset.
